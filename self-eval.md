# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
> Honestly this was a big challenge. It has taken way longer than budgeted. Kind of makes me wonder if there is a better way for me to learn than to just keep making mistakes and then debugging for hours, but it was hard to google solutions for these problems.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
> I've taken a few breaks. Focus has not been an issue, I'm particularly stubborn and once I set my mind to a problem I can usually solve it.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
>I need to make sure I have snacks, water, etc. ready to go!
